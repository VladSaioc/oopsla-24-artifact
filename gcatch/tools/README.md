## Descriptions of tools

GCatch depends on several libraries. In order to change these libraries and
avoid the update of libraries influences the functionality of GCatch, 
in `tools` we forked these libraries.

**Libraries**
1. github.com/system-pclub/GCatch/GCatch/tools/go

   This library contains useful functions for static analysis. 
   GCatch mainly changed the following parts of this library:

   This library provides useful Golang's wrappers of z3 libraries in C. 
   GCatch doesn't change this library.
   
3. z3 

   _Forked around: 01/2021_

    BMOC checker (and go-z3) depends on Z3 to solve the constraints 
    and detect BMOC bugs.

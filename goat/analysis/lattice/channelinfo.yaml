# ChannelInfo description.

name: ChannelInfo
description: ChannelInfo is a member of the lattice of abstract channels.
informal: abstract channel
lattice: lattice of abstract channels
fields:
  - accessor: Capacity
    typename: FlatElement
    typecast: Flat
    stringname: Capacity
    getcomment: retrieves the abstract channel capacity as a flat integer value.
    setcomment: updates the abstract capacity of a channel.
  - accessor: Status
    typename: FlatElement
    typecast: Flat
    stringname: Open?
    getcomment: retrieves the status of the abstract channel, which may be OPEN or CLOSED when known.
    setcomment: updates the status of the abstract channel, as one of ⊥, ⊤, OPEN or CLOSED.
  - accessor: BufferFlat
    typename: FlatElement
    typecast: Flat
    stringname: Buffer (flat)
    getcomment: retrieves the size of the queue of the channel as a member of the flat lattice of integers.
    setcomment: updates the flat representation of the size of the channel queue.
  - accessor: BufferInterval
    typename: Interval
    typecast: Interval
    stringname: Buffer (interval)
    getcomment: retrieves the size of the queue of the channel as a member of the interval lattice.
    setcomment: updates the interval representation of the size of the channel queue.
  - accessor: Payload
    typename: AbstractValue
    typecast: AbstractValue
    stringname: Payload
    getcomment: retrieves the abstract payload of the channel, as an abstract value.
    setcomment: updates the channel payload with the chosen abstract value.

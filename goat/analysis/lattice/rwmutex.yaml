# RWMutex description.

name: RWMutex
description: is a member of the lattice of abstract read-write mutex values.
informal: abstract read-write mutex
lattice: lattice of read-write mutex values
fields:
  - accessor: Status
    typename: FlatElement
    typecast: Flat
    stringname: Status
    getcomment: |
      retrieves the status of the write lock of the read-write mutex
      which may be LOCKED or UNLOCKED when known.
    setcomment: updates the status of the write lock of the read-write mutex as one of  ⊥, ⊤, LOCKED or UNLOCKED.
  - accessor: RLocks
    typename: FlatElement
    typecast: Flat
    stringname: RLocks
    getcomment: |
      retrieves the number of read locks acquired by the read-write mutex
      as a member of the flat lattice of integers.
    setcomment: |
      updates the number of read locks acquired by the read-write mutex
      to a member of the flat lattice of integers.

# Intra-processual charges description

name: Charges
implementation: tree
informal-lattice: lattice of charged return edges
description: |
  is a member of the lattice of charged edges, binding control locations
  to sets of charged control locations, that another control location may
  transfer control flow to as a continuation.
description-lattice: |
  is the lattice of charged return edges, encompassing all possible bindings
  from control locations to charged control location sets, that the key control
  location may transfer control flow to.
informal: charge binding
key: defs.CtrLoc
informal-key: control location
value: InfSet[defs.CtrLoc]
informal-value: charge set
